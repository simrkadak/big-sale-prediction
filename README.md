 The aim of our study is to analyze sales in different supermarkets. Guide we used to define the project:

Definition of the target:
We created an ML framework to analyze the sales of all products in large stores

Data collection:
In general, such studies provide us with products, Provides information including information about features and previous sales representations.

Data Analysis and Cleaning:
Data Interpretation: Examine the first few rows, data types and general statistics to better understand our project.
Missing Values: We find and remove missing values ​​according to the nature of the data.
Outliers: Predicting errors and outliers, which we visualize using boxplots and histograms for data breakdown.
Evaluating Data (EDA)
Univariate analysis: Understand the degree of dispersion of each variable, especially objective variables such as sales. < br>Bivariate analysis: By examining the relationships between variables, determinant variables and key variables, we see sales in different market types and quantities and fewer numbers.
Correlation analysis: We examine the relationship between variables.
Feature Engineering< br>Encoding categorical variables: We use methods such as single-bit encoding and tag encoding to convert categorical variables into formats.
Attribute creation: Create cutting-edge features based on traditional features. When we get detailed information about the initial innovation of the product, we give the "product_age" attribute pattern.
Scaling: We normalize and standardize the number of features to be included in the measurements.
Selection models
The following are the regression functions we consider:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees and Random Forests
Gradient boosting machines such as XGBoost and LightGBM.
Neural Networks for complex data.
Training and Validation
Data Partitioning: We divide data into reports, tests, and tests whenever possible.
Training base: In this step, we get the model selected for our training material.
Model validation: We use the validation process to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework.
Model Evaluation
Regression indicators: Indicators such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), R^2 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) help us validate modelling.
Residual analysis: We analyze the residuals, making sure that the regression hypothesis is met. : We use various hyperparameters to test to determine the best configuration of the framework. .
Key feature: After modeling, we measure the features to be measured. In this way, we provide insight and simplify our framework by eliminating unnecessary functions.
